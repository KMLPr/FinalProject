This is the toString method for my User class that I decided to use to see where the false boolean statement is coming from even if we authenticate with the correct username and password. 
The toString method allowed me to see that the password was returning null instead of the String password. So, in the get statement called getHashPassword I had to change the get statement
to get password instead of hashedpassword.

public String toString(){
        String info = "Username: " + getUsername() + " and Password: " + getHashedPassword() + " and customer ID: ";
        info += getCustomerId();

        return info;
}

Updated getMethod:
public String getHashedPassword() {
        return userData.get("password");
}
