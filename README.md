# FinalProject
This is a public repository showcasing my real-world software development scenario where I will use different data structures and algorithms to complete my objective.  

Setup:
For this final project, I will be working on a Java coding project representing an online shopping platform. In this project there will be multiple objectives and tasks that the user can do such as: creating their own unique account, holding their own shopping cart of online-selected products, being able to search for products by price/category/name, remove selected products, and authorize their payment based on the amount they have on their card.

This project will be following a database system or online shopping platform which will require different ways to organize and handle different users, organizing products by category, name, or product, implementing calculations to find the total price, knowing what is in the shopping cart, updating the shopping cart before payment, and a possible recommendation system. The recommendation system will use past product purchases and recommend a list of products from a hash table based on previous purchases (similar names, product, or price). 

The data structures that will be used will include: hash tables, linked lists, and balanced trees. 
In terms of algorithms: dynammic programming will be used to split up the different smaller tasks of each system outlined from the project set up, radix sort and hashing techniques like linear probing or dynammic perfect hashing.

The major endgoal of this project is to get and organize a set of created user accounts, allow them to shop and browse for specific products using an online shopping cart, sort and search for products, and complete the transaction for the user based on their card balance. 

Installation:
A coding platform such as Java or IntelliJ IDEA CE will be needed to test and set up the corresponding code for this project. 

Execution:
In terms of technical specifications, the project should adhere to the final project outline from the class page. This project will be worked on a broken down into smaller problems before putting it all together in the main program or java class. This project will be done on IntelliJ IDEA CE using Java as the programming language. 
A class diagram will be prepared as well for this. 

Testing will need to be done and outlined on a daily note depending on what problem or section I focus on each day. Not each code will be perfect as it can be revised or scrapped completely if a more optimal method is found. 
Methods to handle exceptions and errors will be critical especially with any NullPointerExceptions or IndexOutOfBounds, etc.
